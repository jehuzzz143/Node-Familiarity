-------------------------- [GLOBAL OBJECT] ----------------------------------------
Node.js global objects are global in nature and they are available in all modules. We do
not need to include these objects in our application, rather we can use them directly. These
objects are modules, functions, strings and object itself as explained below.


[ __filename ]
The __filename represents the filename of the code being executed. This is the resolved
absolute path of this code file

// Create a js file named main.js with the following code:

// Let's try to print the value of __filename
console.log( __filename );

[ __dirname ]
The __dirname represents the name of the directory that the currently executing script
resides in.

// Let's try to print the value of __dirname
console.log( __dirname );

[ Console ]
Used to print information on stdout and stderr.

[ Process ]
Used to get information on current process. Provides multiple events related
to process activities
