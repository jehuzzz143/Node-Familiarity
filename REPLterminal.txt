TERMINAL LESSON

HOW TO USE TERMINAL IN NODEJS

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a
Windows console or Unix/Linux shell where a command is entered and the system
responds with an output in an interactive mode.

/* 
📝 Read - Reads user's input, parses the input into JavaScript data-structure, and stores in memory.
📝 Eval - Takes and evaluates the data structure.
📝 Print - Prints the result.
📝 Loop - Loops the above command until the user presses ctrl-c twice
*/

USE VARIABLE

If var keyword is not used, then the value is stored in the variable and printed. 
Whereas if var keyword is used, then the value is stored but not printed. You can print variables using
try this to terminal

SAMPLE IN TERMINAL 
$ node
> x = 10 
10
> var y = 10
undefined
> x + y
20
> console.log("Hello World")
Hello Workd
undefined

MULTILINE EXPRESSION
$ node
> var x = 0
undefined
> do {
... x++;
... console.log("x: " + x);
... } while ( x < 5 );
x: 1
x: 2
x: 3
x: 4
x: 5
undefined

 ctrl + d - terminate the Node REPL.
 Up/Down Keys - see command history and modify previous commands.
 tab Keys - list of current commands.
 .help - list of all commands.
 .break - exit from multiline expression.

NPM

Two Main Functionalities
1. Online respositories for node.js packages/modules which is searchable on search.nodejs.org
2. Command utility to install nodejs packages, do version management and dependencies of node.js packages

npm install <packages> = the way how to install
npm uninstall <packages> = the way how to uninstall
-g = global
-l = local
npm ls -g = list the global packages
npm ls -l = list the local packages
